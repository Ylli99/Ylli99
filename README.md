- 👋 Hi @everyone, I'm @Ylli
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science in general. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react, in order to build powerful applications, and the development of a game, a retro-server of Metin2, but totally made by me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on that last project I'm working on.
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail me @ylliineziri@gmail.com or add me on discord @Ylli#3576
